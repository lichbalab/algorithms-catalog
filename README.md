## MinWeightFinder
In each cell of the rectangular table

NÃ—M is a number. Initially, the player is in the upper left cell. In one move, he is allowed to move to an adjacent cell either to the right or down (it is prohibited to move to the left and up). When passing through a cell, the player is taken as many kilograms of food as the number written in this cell (food is also taken for the first and last cells of his path).

You need to find the minimum weight of food in kilograms, giving which the player can get into the lower right corner.
